## Quiz App with React 

* I really enjoy creating this Quiz app With an API called `https://opentdb.com/`

### What problem i face when creating this quiz-app?
* 1-> Showing the correct answer and not correct answer option with different colors and design. 
* For this I write topics in my diary in sequence 
  * 1-> Show correct answer in green 
  * 2-> Show wrong answer in red 
* firstly i try with STATE and gave then color and use but didn't work properly after that i use condional rendering in JSX file and it work great.
